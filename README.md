# data_mining_on_divarDataset

## Introduction
This project tries to clean data and check dataset having acceptable values and then shows implementation of some algorithm in frequent pattern, clustering and classification on Divar dataset.

### Implement data cleaning:
This stage of the project was checked all columns and rows to have acceptable values. If it has Null or unacceptable values, it was filled by "unknown" or "mean of data in column".

also Completeness was checked in 3 way:

Measurement Function A/B 


1.	
o	A: records with no missing attribute
o	B: Total records in a dataset

2.	
o	A: number of data required for the particular context in the data file
o	B: number of data in the specified particular context of intended use

3.	
o	A: attribute fields containing values 
o	B: records × attributes


At the end, third method had better result because our missing values were broadcasted.


frequent pattern, 
clustering
and classification 
on Divar dataset.
